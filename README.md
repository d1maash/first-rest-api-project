# first-rest-api-project
contact-save-project-in-expressjs

My first Rest Api project. This is a project that saves contacts based on NodeJS ExpressJS. I made this project watching a video on YouTube that lasts an hour and a half. This project uses the Rest Api to save contacts and you can delete or change them. Yes, I know that this is a regular project, I just fill everything in here so as not to lose my first projects.
